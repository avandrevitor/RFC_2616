<h3>1.1 Purpose</h3>
<p>
    The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level
    protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information
    systems. HTTP has been in use by the World-Wide Web global
    information initiative since 1990. The first version of HTTP,
    referred to as HTTP/0.9, was a simple protocol for raw data transfer
    across the Internet. HTTP/1.0, as defined by RFC 1945 [6], improved
    the protocol by allowing messages to be in the format of MIME-like
    messages, containing metainformation about the data transferred and
    modifiers on the request/response semantics. However, HTTP/1.0 does
    not sufficiently take into consideration the effects of hierarchical
    proxies, caching, the need for persistent connections, or virtual
    hosts. In addition, the proliferation of incompletely-implemented
    applications calling themselves "HTTP/1.0" has necessitated a
    protocol version change in order for two communicating applications
    to determine each other's true capabilities.
</p>
<p>
    This specification defines the protocol referred to as "HTTP/1.1".
    This protocol includes more stringent requirements than HTTP/1.0 in
    order to ensure reliable implementation of its features.
</p>
<p>
    Practical information systems require more functionality than simple
    retrieval, including search, front-end update, and annotation. HTTP
    allows an open-ended set of methods and headers that indicate the
    purpose of a request [47]. It builds on the discipline of reference
    provided by the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) [3], as a location
    (URL) [4] or name (URN) [20], for indicating the resource to which a
    method is to be applied. Messages are passed in a format similar to
    that used by Internet mail [9] as defined by the Multipurpose
Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) [7].
</p>
<p>
    HTTP is also used as a generic protocol for communication between
    user agents and proxies/gateways to other Internet systems, including
    those supported by the SMTP [16], NNTP [13], FTP [18], Gopher [2],
    and WAIS [10] protocols. In this way, HTTP allows basic hypermedia
    access to resources available from diverse applications.

<h3>1.2 Requirements</h3>
<p>
    The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
    "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
    document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [34].
</p>
<p>
    An implementation is not compliant if it fails to satisfy one or more
    of the MUST or REQUIRED level requirements for the protocols it
    implements. An implementation that satisfies all the MUST or REQUIRED
    level and all the SHOULD level requirements for its protocols is said
    to be "unconditionally compliant"; one that satisfies all the MUST
    level requirements but not all the SHOULD level requirements for its
    protocols is said to be "conditionally compliant."
</p>
<h3>1.3 Terminology</h3>
<p>
    This specification uses a number of terms to refer to the roles
    played by participants in, and objects of, the HTTP communication.
</p>
<div>
    <h4>connection</h4>
    <p>
        A transport layer virtual circuit established between two programs
        for the purpose of communication.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h4>message</h4>
    <p>
        The basic unit of HTTP communication, consisting of a structured
        sequence of octets matching the syntax defined in section 4 and
        transmitted via the connection.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h4>request</h4>
    <p>
        An HTTP request message, as defined in section 5.
    </p>
</div>
<div>
    <h4>response</h4>
    <p>
        An HTTP response message, as defined in section 6.
    </p>
