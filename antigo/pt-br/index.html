            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            <p>
                The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level
               protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information
               systems. It is a generic, stateless, protocol which can be used for
               many tasks beyond its use for hypertext, such as name servers and
               distributed object management systems, through extension of its
               request methods, error codes and headers [47]. A feature of HTTP is
               the typing and negotiation of data representation, allowing systems
               to be built independently of the data being transferred.
            </p>
            <p>
               HTTP has been in use by the World-Wide Web global information
               initiative since 1990. This specification defines the protocol
               referred to as "HTTP/1.1", and is an update to RFC 2068 [33].
