<h1>3 Protocol Parameters</h1>
<hr class="col-md-12">
<h2 id="sec0">3.1 HTTP Version</h2>
<p>
    HTTP uses a "&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;" numbering scheme to indicate versions
   of the protocol. The protocol versioning policy is intended to allow
   the sender to indicate the format of a message and its capacity for
   understanding further HTTP communication, rather than the features
   obtained via that communication. No change is made to the version
   number for the addition of message components which do not affect
   communication behavior or which only add to extensible field values.
   The &lt;minor&gt; number is incremented when the changes made to the
   protocol add features which do not change the general message parsing
   algorithm, but which may add to the message semantics and imply
   additional capabilities of the sender. The &lt;major&gt; number is
   incremented when the format of a message within the protocol is
   changed. See RFC 2145 [36] for a fuller explanation.
</p>
<p>
   The version of an HTTP message is indicated by an HTTP-Version field
   in the first line of the message.
</p>
<p class="text-center">
    HTTP-Version = "HTTP" "/" 1*DIGIT "." 1*DIGIT
</p>
<p>
     Note that the major and minor numbers MUST be treated as separate
   integers and that each MAY be incremented higher than a single digit.
   Thus, HTTP/2.4 is a lower version than HTTP/2.13, which in turn is
   lower than HTTP/12.3. Leading zeros MUST be ignored by recipients and
   MUST NOT be sent.
</p>
<p>
    An application that sends a request or response message that includes
   HTTP-Version of "HTTP/1.1" MUST be at least conditionally compliant
   with this specification. Applications that are at least conditionally
   compliant with this specification SHOULD use an HTTP-Version of
   "HTTP/1.1" in their messages, and MUST do so for any message that is
   not compatible with HTTP/1.0. For more details on when to send
   specific HTTP-Version values, see RFC 2145 [36]
</p>
<p>
    The HTTP version of an application is the highest HTTP version for
   which the application is at least conditionally compliant.
</p>
<p>
    Proxy and gateway applications need to be careful when forwarding
   messages in protocol versions different from that of the application.
   Since the protocol version indicates the protocol capability of the
   sender, a proxy/gateway MUST NOT send a message with a version
   indicator which is greater than its actual version. If a higher
   version request is received, the proxy/gateway MUST either downgrade
   the request version, or respond with an error, or switch to tunnel
   behavior.
</p>
<p>
    Due to interoperability problems with HTTP/1.0 proxies discovered
   since the publication of RFC 2068[33], caching proxies MUST, gateways
   MAY, and tunnels MUST NOT upgrade the request to the highest version
   they support. The proxy/gateway's response to that request MUST be in
   the same major version as the request.
</p>
<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>Converting between versions of HTTP may involve modification of header 
        fields required or forbidden by the versions involved.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<h2 id="sec1">3.2 Uniform Resource Identifiers</h2>
<p>
    URIs have been known by many names: WWW addresses, Universal Document
   Identifiers, Universal Resource Identifiers [3], and finally the
   combination of Uniform Resource Locators (URL) [4] and Names (URN)
   [20]. As far as HTTP is concerned, Uniform Resource Identifiers are
   simply formatted strings which identify--via name, location, or any
   other characteristic--a resource.
</p>
<br/>
<h2 id="sec2">3.2.1 General Syntax</h2>
<p>
   URIs in HTTP can be represented in absolute form or relative to some
   known base URI [11], depending upon the context of their use. The two
   forms are differentiated by the fact that absolute URIs always begin
   with a scheme name followed by a colon. For definitive information on
   URL syntax and semantics, see "Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI):
   Generic Syntax and Semantics," RFC 2396 [42] (which replaces RFCs
   1738 [4] and RFC 1808 [11]). This specification adopts the
   definitions of "URI-reference", "absoluteURI", "relativeURI", "port",
   "host","abs_path", "rel_path", and "authority" from that
   specification.
</p>
<p>
    The HTTP protocol does not place any a priori limit on the length of
   a URI. Servers MUST be able to handle the URI of any resource they
   serve, and SHOULD be able to handle URIs of unbounded length if they
   provide GET-based forms that could generate such URIs. A server
   SHOULD return 414 (Request-URI Too Long) status if a URI is longer
   than the server can handle (see section 10.4.15).
</p>
<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>Servers ought to be cautious about depending on URI lengths
      above 255 bytes, because some older client or proxy
      implementations might not properly support these lengths.</p>
</div>
<br/>
<h2 id="sec4">3.2.2 HTTP URL</h2>
<p>
    The "http" scheme is used to locate network resources via the HTTP
   protocol. This section defines the scheme-specific syntax and
   semantics for http URLs.
</p>
<p class="text-center">
    http_URL= "http:" "//" host [ ":" port ] [ abs_path [ "?" query ]]
</p>
<p>
    If the port is empty or not given, port 80 is assumed. The semantics
   are that the identified resource is located at the server listening
   for TCP connections on that port of that host, and the Request-URI
   for the resource is abs_path (section 5.1.2). The use of IP addresses
   in URLs SHOULD be avoided whenever possible (see RFC 1900 [24]). If
   the abs_path is not present in the URL, it MUST be given as "/" when
   used as a Request-URI for a resource (section 5.1.2). If a proxy
   receives a host name which is not a fully qualified domain name, it
   MAY add its domain to the host name it received. If a proxy receives
   a fully qualified domain name, the proxy MUST NOT change the host
   name.
</p>
<br/>
<h2 id="sec4">3.2.3 URI Comparison</h2>
<p>
    When comparing two URIs to decide if they match or not, a client
   SHOULD use a case-sensitive octet-by-octet comparison of the entire
   URIs, with these exceptions:
</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled">
    <li>A port that is empty or not given is equivalent to the default
        port for that URI-reference;
        <ul>
            <li>Comparisons of host names MUST be case-insensitive;</li>
            <li>Comparisons of scheme names MUST be case-insensitive;</li>
            <li>An empty abs_path is equivalent to an abs_path of "/".</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Characters other than those in the "reserved" and "unsafe" sets (see
   RFC 2396 [42]) are equivalent to their ""%" HEX HEX" encoding.
</p>
<p>
    For example, the following three URIs are equivalent:
</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled">
    <li>http://abc.com:80/~smith/home.html</li>
    <li>http://ABC.com/%7Esmith/home.html</li>
    <li>http://ABC.com:/%7esmith/home.html</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<h2 id="sec5">3.3 Date/Time Formats</h2>
<h3 id="sec5.1">3.3.1 Full Date</h3>
<p>
    HTTP applications have historically allowed three different formats
   for the representation of date/time stamps:
</p>
<ul class="list-unstyled">
    <li>Sun, 06 Nov 1994 08:49:37 GMT  ; RFC 822, updated by RFC 1123</li>
    <li>Sunday, 06-Nov-94 08:49:37 GMT ; RFC 850, obsoleted by RFC 1036</li>
    <li> Sun Nov  6 08:49:37 1994       ; ANSI C's asctime() format</li>
</ul>
<p>The first format is preferred as an Internet standard and represents
   a fixed-length subset of that defined by RFC 1123 [8] (an update to
   RFC 822 [9]). The second format is in common use, but is based on the
   obsolete RFC 850 [12] date format and lacks a four-digit year.
   HTTP/1.1 clients and servers that parse the date value MUST accept
   all three formats (for compatibility with HTTP/1.0), though they MUST
   only generate the RFC 1123 format for representing HTTP-date values
   in header fields. See section 19.3 for further information.
</p>
<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>Recipients of date values are encouraged to be robust in
      accepting date values that may have been sent by non-HTTP
      applications, as is sometimes the case when retrieving or posting
      messages via proxies/gateways to SMTP or NNTP.
    </p>
</div>
<p>
    All HTTP date/time stamps MUST be represented in Greenwich Mean Time
   (GMT), without exception. For the purposes of HTTP, GMT is exactly
   equal to UTC (Coordinated Universal Time). This is indicated in the
   first two formats by the inclusion of "GMT" as the three-letter
   abbreviation for time zone, and MUST be assumed when reading the
   asctime format. HTTP-date is case sensitive and MUST NOT include
   additional LWS beyond that specifically included as SP in the
   grammar.
</p>
<dl class="dl-horizontal">
  <dt>HTTP-date</dt><dd>= rfc1123-date | rfc850-date | asctime-date</dd>

  <dt>month</dt><dd>= "Jan" | "Feb" | "Mar" | "Apr" | "May" | "Jun" | "Jul" | "Aug" | "Sep" | "Oct" | "Nov" | "Dec"</dd>
</dl>
<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>HTTP requirements for the date/time stamp format apply only
      to their usage within the protocol stream. Clients and servers are
      not required to use these formats for user presentation, request
      logging, etc.
    </p>
</div>
<br/>
<h3 id="sec5.2">3.3.2 Delta Seconds</h3>
<p>
    Some HTTP header fields allow a time value to be specified as an
   integer number of seconds, represented in decimal, after the time
   that the message was received.
</p>
<p class="text-center">
    delta-seconds  = 1*DIGIT
</p>
<br/>
<h2 id="sec6">3.4 Character Sets</h2>
<p>
    HTTP uses the same definition of the term "character set" as that
   described for MIME:
</p>
<p>
    The term "character set" is used in this document to refer to a
   method used with one or more tables to convert a sequence of octets
   into a sequence of characters. Note that unconditional conversion in
   the other direction is not required, in that not all characters may
   be available in a given character set and a character set may provide
   more than one sequence of octets to represent a particular character.
   This definition is intended to allow various kinds of character
   encoding, from simple single-table mappings such as US-ASCII to
   complex table switching methods such as those that use ISO-2022's
   techniques. However, the definition associated with a MIME character
   set name MUST fully specify the mapping to be performed from octets
   to characters. In particular, use of external profiling information
   to determine the exact mapping is not permitted.
</p>
<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
    <h4>Note</h4>
    <p>This use of the term "character set" is more commonly
      referred to as a "character encoding." However, since HTTP and
      MIME share the same registry, it is important that the terminology
      also be shared.</p>
</div>
<p>
    HTTP character sets are identified by case-insensitive tokens. The
   complete set of tokens is defined by the IANA Character Set registry
   [19].
</p>
<p class="text-center">
    charset = token
</p>
<p>
    Although HTTP allows an arbitrary token to be used as a charset
   value, any token that has a predefined value within the IANA
   Character Set registry [19] MUST represent the character set defined
   by that registry. Applications SHOULD limit their use of character
   sets to those defined by the IANA registry.
</p>
<p>
    Implementors should be aware of IETF character set requirements [38]
   [41].
</p>
<h3 id="sec6.1">3.4.1 Missing Charset</h3>
<p>
    Some HTTP/1.0 software has interpreted a Content-Type header without
   charset parameter incorrectly to mean "recipient should guess."
   Senders wishing to defeat this behavior MAY include a charset
   parameter even when the charset is ISO-8859-1 and SHOULD do so when
   it is known that it will not confuse the recipient.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, some older HTTP/1.0 clients did not deal properly with
   an explicit charset parameter. HTTP/1.1 recipients MUST respect the
   charset label provided by the sender; and those user agents that have
   a provision to "guess" a charset MUST use the charset from the 
   content-type field if they support that charset, rather than the
   recipient's preference, when initially displaying a document. See
   section 3.7.1.
</p>
<br/>
<h2 id="sec7">3.5 Content Codings</h2>
<p>
    Content coding values indicate an encoding transformation that has
   been or can be applied to an entity. Content codings are primarily
   used to allow a document to be compressed or otherwise usefully
   transformed without losing the identity of its underlying media type
   and without loss of information. Frequently, the entity is stored in
   coded form, transmitted directly, and only decoded by the recipient.
</p>
<p class="text-center">
     content-coding   = token
</p>
<p>
     All content-coding values are case-insensitive. HTTP/1.1 uses
   content-coding values in the Accept-Encoding (section 14.3) and
   Content-Encoding (section 14.11) header fields. Although the value
   describes the content-coding, what is more important is that it
   indicates what decoding mechanism will be required to remove the
   encoding.
</p>
<p>
   The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) acts as a registry for
   content-coding value tokens. Initially, the registry contains the
   following tokens:
</p>
<dl class="dl-horizontal">
  <dt>gzip</dt>
  <dd>An encoding format produced by the file compression program
        "gzip" (GNU zip) as described in RFC 1952 [25]. This format is a
        Lempel-Ziv coding (LZ77) with a 32 bit CRC.</dd>
  <dt>compress</dt>
  <dd>The encoding format produced by the common UNIX file compression
        program "compress". This format is an adaptive Lempel-Ziv-Welch
        coding (LZW).</dd>
  <dt>compress</dt>
  <dd> The encoding format produced by the common UNIX file compression
        program "compress". This format is an adaptive Lempel-Ziv-Welch
        coding (LZW).<br/>
        Use of program names for the identification of encoding formats
        is not desirable and is discouraged for future encodings. Their
        use here is representative of historical practice, not good
        design. For compatibility with previous implementations of HTTP,
        applications SHOULD consider "x-gzip" and "x-compress" to be
        equivalent to "gzip" and "compress" respectively.
  </dd>
  <dt>deflate</dt>
  <dd>
      The "zlib" format defined in RFC 1950 [31] in combination with
        the "deflate" compression mechanism described in RFC 1951 [29].
  </dd>
  <dt>identity</dt>
  <dd>
     The default (identity) encoding; the use of no transformation
        whatsoever. This content-coding is used only in the Accept-
        Encoding header, and SHOULD NOT be used in the Content-Encoding
        header.
  </dd>
</dl>
<p>
    New content-coding value tokens SHOULD be registered; to allow
   interoperability between clients and servers, specifications of the
   content coding algorithms needed to implement a new value SHOULD be
   publicly available and adequate for independent implementation, and
   conform to the purpose of content coding defined in this section.
</p>
<br/>
<h2 id="sec8">3.6 Transfer Codings</h2>
<p>
    Transfer-coding values are used to indicate an encoding
   transformation that has been, can be, or may need to be applied to an
   entity-body in order to ensure "safe transport" through the network.
   This differs from a content coding in that the transfer-coding is a
   property of the message, not of the original entity.
</p>
<dl class="dl-horizontal">
  <dd>transfer-coding = "chunked" | transfer-extension</dd>
  <dd>transfer-extension      = token *( ";" parameter )</dd>
</dl>
<p>
    Notational Conventions and Generic Grammar
</p>
<dl class="dl-horizontal">
  <dd>parameter               = attribute "=" value</dd>
  <dd>transfer-extension      = token *( ";" parameter )</dd>
  <dd>value                   = token | quoted-string</dd>
</dl>
<p>
    All transfer-coding values are case-insensitive. HTTP/1.1 uses
   transfer-coding values in the TE header field (section 14.39) and in
   the Transfer-Encoding header field (section 14.41).
</p>
<p>
    Whenever a transfer-coding is applied to a message-body, the set of
   transfer-codings MUST include "chunked", unless the message is
   terminated by closing the connection. When the "chunked" transfer-
   coding is used, it MUST be the last transfer-coding applied to the
   message-body. The "chunked" transfer-coding MUST NOT be applied more
   than once to a message-body. These rules allow the recipient to
   determine the transfer-length of the message (section 4.4).
</p>
<p>
    Transfer-codings are analogous to the Content-Transfer-Encoding
   values of MIME [7], which were designed to enable safe transport of
   binary data over a 7-bit transport service. However, safe transport
   has a different focus for an 8bit-clean transfer protocol. In HTTP,
   the only unsafe characteristic of message-bodies is the difficulty in
   determining the exact body length (section 7.2.2), or the desire to
   encrypt data over a shared transport.
</p>
<p>
    The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) acts as a registry for
   transfer-coding value tokens. Initially, the registry contains the
   following tokens: "chunked" (section 3.6.1), "identity" (section
   3.6.2), "gzip" (section 3.5), "compress" (section 3.5), and "deflate"
   (section 3.5).
</p>
<p>
    New transfer-coding value tokens SHOULD be registered in the same way
   as new content-coding value tokens (section 3.5).
</p>
<p>
    A server which receives an entity-body with a transfer-coding it does
   not understand SHOULD return 501 (Unimplemented), and close the
   connection. A server MUST NOT send transfer-codings to an HTTP/1.0
   client.
</p>
<br/>
<h3 id="sec9">3.6.1 Chunked Transfer Coding</h3>
<p>
    The chunked encoding modifies the body of a message in order to
   transfer it as a series of chunks, each with its own size indicator,
   followed by an OPTIONAL trailer containing entity-header fields. This
   allows dynamically produced content to be transferred along with the
   information necessary for the recipient to verify that it has
   received the full message.
</p>
<dl class="dl-horizontal">
  <dt>Chunked-Body</dt>
  <dd>= *chunk<br/>
    last-chunk<br/>
    trailer<br/>
    CRLF</dd>
  <dt>chunk</dt><dd>= chunk-size [ chunk-extension ] CRLF<br/>chunk-data CRLF</dd>
  <dt>chunk-size</dt><dd>= 1*HEX</dd>
  <dt>last-chunk</dt><dd>= 1*("0") [ chunk-extension ] CRLF</dd>
  <dt>chunk-extension</dt><dd>= *( ";" chunk-ext-name [ "=" chunk-ext-val ] )</dd>
  <dt>chunk-ext-name</dt><dd>= token</dd>
  <dt>chunk-ext-val</dt><dd>= token | quoted-string</dd>
  <dt>chunk-data</dt><dd>= chunk-size(OCTET)</dd>
  <dt>trailer</dt><dd>= *(entity-header CRLF)</dd>
</dl>
<p>
    The chunk-size field is a string of hex digits indicating the size of
   the chunk. The chunked encoding is ended by any chunk whose size is
   zero, followed by the trailer, which is terminated by an empty line.
</p>
<p>
    The trailer allows the sender to include additional HTTP header
   fields at the end of the message. The Trailer header field can be
   used to indicate which header fields are included in a trailer (see
   section 14.40).
</p>
<p>
    A server using chunked transfer-coding in a response MUST NOT use the
   trailer for any header fields unless at least one of the following is
   true:
</p>
<p>
    a)the request included a TE header field that indicates "trailers" is
     acceptable in the transfer-coding of the  response, as described in
     section 14.39; or,
</p>
<p>
    b)the server is the origin server for the response, the trailer
     fields consist entirely of optional metadata, and the recipient
     could use the message (in a manner acceptable to the origin server)
     without receiving this metadata.  In other words, the origin server
     is willing to accept the possibility that the trailer fields might
     be silently discarded along the path to the client.
</p>
<p>
    This requirement prevents an interoperability failure when the
   message is being received by an HTTP/1.1 (or later) proxy and
   forwarded to an HTTP/1.0 recipient. It avoids a situation where
   compliance with the protocol would have necessitated a possibly
   infinite buffer on the proxy.
</p>
<p>
     An example process for decoding a Chunked-Body is presented in
   appendix 19.4.6.
</p>
<p>
    All HTTP/1.1 applications MUST be able to receive and decode the
   "chunked" transfer-coding, and MUST ignore chunk-extension extensions
   they do not understand.
</p>
<br/>
<h2 id="sec10">3.7 Media Types</h2>
<p>HTTP uses Internet Media Types [17] in the Content-Type (section
   14.17) and Accept (section 14.1) header fields in order to provide
   open and extensible data typing and type negotiation.
</p>
<dl class="dl-horizontal">
  <dt>media-type</dt><dd>= type "/" subtype *( ";" parameter )</dd>
  <dt>type</dt><dd>= token</dd>
  <dt>subtype</dt><dd>= token</dd>
</dl>
<p>
    Parameters MAY follow the type/subtype in the form of attribute/value
   pairs (as defined in section 3.6).
</p>
<p>
    The type, subtype, and parameter attribute names are case-
   insensitive. Parameter values might or might not be case-sensitive,
   depending on the semantics of the parameter name. Linear white space
   (LWS) MUST NOT be used between the type and subtype, nor between an
   attribute and its value. The presence or absence of a parameter might
   be significant to the processing of a media-type, depending on its
   definition within the media type registry.
</p>
<p>Note that some older HTTP applications do not recognize media type
   parameters. When sending data to older HTTP applications,
   implementations SHOULD only use media type parameters when they are
   required by that type/subtype definition.
</p>
<p>
    Media-type values are registered with the Internet Assigned Number
   Authority (IANA [19]). The media type registration process is
   outlined in RFC 1590 [17]. Use of non-registered media types is
   discouraged.
</p>
<br/>
<h3 id="sec11">3.7.1 Canonicalization and Text Defaults</h3>
<p>
    Internet media types are registered with a canonical form. An
   entity-body transferred via HTTP messages MUST be represented in the
   appropriate canonical form prior to its transmission except for
   "text" types, as defined in the next paragraph.
</p>
<p>
    When in canonical form, media subtypes of the "text" type use CRLF as
   the text line break. HTTP relaxes this requirement and allows the
   transport of text media with plain CR or LF alone representing a line
   break when it is done consistently for an entire entity-body. HTTP
   applications MUST accept CRLF, bare CR, and bare LF as being
   representative of a line break in text media received via HTTP. In
   addition, if the text is represented in a character set that does not
   use octets 13 and 10 for CR and LF respectively, as is the case for
   some multi-byte character sets, HTTP allows the use of whatever octet
   sequences are defined by that character set to represent the
   equivalent of CR and LF for line breaks. This flexibility regarding
   line breaks applies only to text media in the entity-body; a bare CR
   or LF MUST NOT be substituted for CRLF within any of the HTTP control
   structures (such as header fields and multipart boundaries).
</p>
<p>
    If an entity-body is encoded with a content-coding, the underlying
   data MUST be in a form defined above prior to being encoded.
</p>
<p>
    The "charset" parameter is used with some media types to define the
   character set (section 3.4) of the data. When no explicit charset
   parameter is provided by the sender, media subtypes of the "text"
   type are defined to have a default charset value of "ISO-8859-1" when
   received via HTTP. Data in character sets other than "ISO-8859-1" or
   its subsets MUST be labeled with an appropriate charset value. See
   section 3.4.1 for compatibility problems.
</p>
<br/>
<h3 id="sec12">3.7.2 Multipart Types</h3>
<p>
    MIME provides for a number of "multipart" types -- encapsulations of
   one or more entities within a single message-body. All multipart
   types share a common syntax, as defined in section 5.1.1 of RFC 2046
   [40], and MUST include a boundary parameter as part of the media type
   value. The message body is itself a protocol element and MUST
   therefore use only CRLF to represent line breaks between body-parts.
   Unlike in RFC 2046, the epilogue of any multipart message MUST be
   empty; HTTP applications MUST NOT transmit the epilogue (even if the
   original multipart contains an epilogue). These restrictions exist in
   order to preserve the self-delimiting nature of a multipart message-
   body, wherein the "end" of the message-body is indicated by the
   ending multipart boundary.
</p>
<p>
    In general, HTTP treats a multipart message-body no differently than
   any other media type: strictly as payload. The one exception is the
   "multipart/byteranges" type (appendix 19.2) when it appears in a 206
   (Partial Content) response, which will be interpreted by some HTTP
   caching mechanisms as described in sections 13.5.4 and 14.16. In all
   other cases, an HTTP user agent SHOULD follow the same or similar
   behavior as a MIME user agent would upon receipt of a multipart type.
   The MIME header fields within each body-part of a multipart message-
   body do not have any significance to HTTP beyond that defined by
   their MIME semantics.
</p>
<p>
    In general, an HTTP user agent SHOULD follow the same or similar
   behavior as a MIME user agent would upon receipt of a multipart type.
   If an application receives an unrecognized multipart subtype, the
   application MUST treat it as being equivalent to "multipart/mixed".
</p>
<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
    <h4>Note:</h4>
    <p>The "multipart/form-data" type has been specifically defined
      for carrying form data suitable for processing via the POST
      request method, as described in RFC 1867 [15].
    </p>
</div>

<h2 id="sec13">3.8 Product Tokens</h2>
<p>
    Product tokens are used to allow communicating applications to
   identify themselves by software name and version. Most fields using
   product tokens also allow sub-products which form a significant part
   of the application to be listed, separated by white space. By
   convention, the products are listed in order of their significance
   for identifying the application.
</p>
<dl class="dl-horizontal">
  <dt>product</dt><dd>= token ["/" product-version]</dd>
  <dt>product-version</dt><dd>= token</dd>
</dl>
<p>
    Examples:
</p>
<dl class="dl-horizontal">
  <dt>User-Agent:</dt><dd> CERN-LineMode/2.15 libwww/2.17b3</dd>
  <dt>Server:</dt><dd> Apache/0.8.4</dd>
</dl>
<p>
    Product tokens SHOULD be short and to the point. They MUST NOT be
   used for advertising or other non-essential information. Although any
   token character MAY appear in a product-version, this token SHOULD
   only be used for a version identifier (i.e., successive versions of
   the same product SHOULD only differ in the product-version portion of
   the product value).
</p>
<br/>
<h2 id="sec14">3.9 Quality Values</h2>
<p>
    HTTP content negotiation (section 12) uses short "floating point"
   numbers to indicate the relative importance ("weight") of various
   negotiable parameters.  A weight is normalized to a real number in
   the range 0 through 1, where 0 is the minimum and 1 the maximum
   value. If a parameter has a quality value of 0, then content with
   this parameter is `not acceptable' for the client. HTTP/1.1
   applications MUST NOT generate more than three digits after the
   decimal point. User configuration of these values SHOULD also be
   limited in this fashion.
</p>
<p class="text-center">
    qvalue = ( "0" [ "." 0*3DIGIT ] ) | ( "1" [ "." 0*3("0") ] )
</p>
<p>
    "Quality values" is a misnomer, since these values merely represent
   relative degradation in desired quality.
</p>
<br/>
<h2 id="sec15">3.10 Language Tags</h2>
<p>
    A language tag identifies a natural language spoken, written, or
   otherwise conveyed by human beings for communication of information
   to other human beings. Computer languages are explicitly excluded.
   HTTP uses language tags within the Accept-Language and Content-
   Language fields.
</p>
<p>
    The syntax and registry of HTTP language tags is the same as that
   defined by RFC 1766 [1]. In summary, a language tag is composed of 1
   or more parts: A primary language tag and a possibly empty series of
   subtags:
</p>
<dl class="dl-horizontal">
  <dt>language-tag</dt><dd>= primary-tag *( "-" subtag )</dd>
  <dt>primary-tag</dt><dd>= 1*8ALPHA</dd>
  <dt>subtag</dt><dd>= 1*8ALPHA</dd>
</dl>
<p>
    White space is not allowed within the tag and all tags are case-
   insensitive. The name space of language tags is administered by the
   IANA. Example tags include:
</p>
<p class='text-center'>en, en-US, en-cockney, i-cherokee, x-pig-latin</p>
<p>
    where any two-letter primary-tag is an ISO-639 language abbreviation
   and any two-letter initial subtag is an ISO-3166 country code. (The
   last three tags above are not registered tags; all but the last are
   examples of tags which could be registered in future.)
</p>
<br/>
<h2 id="sec16">3.11 Entity Tags</h2>
<p>
    Entity tags are used for comparing two or more entities from the same
   requested resource. HTTP/1.1 uses entity tags in the ETag (section
   14.19), If-Match (section 14.24), If-None-Match (section 14.26), and
   If-Range (section 14.27) header fields. The definition of how they
   are used and compared as cache validators is in section 13.3.3. An
   entity tag consists of an opaque quoted string, possibly prefixed by
   a weakness indicator.
</p>
<dl class="dl-horizontal">
  <dt>entity-tag</dt><dd>= [ weak ] opaque-tag</dd>
  <dt>weak</dt><dd>= "W/"</dd>
  <dt>opaque-tag</dt><dd>= quoted-string</dd>
</dl>
<p>
    A "strong entity tag" MAY be shared by two entities of a resource
   only if they are equivalent by octet equality.
</p>
<p>
    A "weak entity tag," indicated by the "W/" prefix, MAY be shared by
   two entities of a resource only if the entities are equivalent and
   could be substituted for each other with no significant change in
   semantics. A weak entity tag can only be used for weak comparison.
</p>
<p>
    An entity tag MUST be unique across all versions of all entities
   associated with a particular resource. A given entity tag value MAY
   be used for entities obtained by requests on different URIs. The use
   of the same entity tag value in conjunction with entities obtained by
   requests on different URIs does not imply the equivalence of those
   entities.
</p>
<br/>
<h2 id="sec17">3.12 Range Units</h2>
<p>
    HTTP/1.1 allows a client to request that only part (a range of) the
   response entity be included within the response. HTTP/1.1 uses range
   units in the Range (section 14.35) and Content-Range (section 14.16)
   header fields. An entity can be broken down into subranges according
   to various structural units.
</p>
<dl class="dl-horizontal">
  <dt>range-unit</dt><dd>= bytes-unit | other-range-unit</dd>
  <dt>bytes-unit</dt><dd>= "bytes"</dd>
  <dt>other-range-unit</dt><dd>= token</dd>
</dl>
<p>
    The only range unit defined by HTTP/1.1 is "bytes". HTTP/1.1
   implementations MAY ignore ranges specified using other units.
   HTTP/1.1 has been designed to allow implementations of applications
   that do not depend on knowledge of ranges.
</p>
